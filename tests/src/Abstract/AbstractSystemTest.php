 * This test class is dedicated to validating the AbstractSystem class, which serves

 * class, we test its concrete behaviors by creating an anonymous class that extends it.
 *
 * The tests within this class ensure three key aspects:
 * 1.  Correct dependency injection and property initialization through the constructor.
 * 2.  The initial state of properties to prevent unexpected null values.
 * 3.  The correct functionality of public methods like `registerRouter`.
